# Web Compiler Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. System.out.print() Timeout Issue
**Problem**: `System.out.print()` was causing timeouts because the output wasn't being flushed properly.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `futureRead()` method in `CompilerController.java` to use `readAllBuffered()` instead of line-by-line reading
- Updated WebSocket handler to read character-by-character instead of line-by-line
- Added proper buffer flushing in input handling

### 2. Integer Output Issues
**Problem**: Integer outputs and loop counters weren't displaying properly due to buffering issues.

**Solution**:
- Implemented character-by-character reading to capture all output immediately
- Added proper environment variables in Docker container for UTF-8 encoding
- Enhanced input/output stream handling

### 3. User Input Handling
**Problem**: Scanner operations and user input weren't working consistently.

**Solution**:
- Improved stdin input handling with proper flushing
- Added explicit output stream flushing after input
- Enhanced error handling for NoSuchElementException

## Technical Changes

### CompilerController.java
- Added `readAllBuffered()` method for proper output capture
- Enhanced process execution with environment variables
- Improved stdin input handling with explicit flushing

### CompilerWebSocketHandler.java
- Modified output reading to use character buffers instead of line reading
- Enhanced input handling with proper stream flushing
- Improved error handling and process management

### Dockerfile
- Added environment variables for proper Java buffering behavior
- Set UTF-8 encoding and proper temp directory configuration

## Testing

Use the provided `test_compiler.java` file to verify all fixes work:
- System.out.print() without newline
- Integer operations and output
- Loop counters with System.out.print()
- String input handling
- Mixed input types (int, String)

## Usage

The compiler now properly handles:
- ✅ System.out.print() without timeouts
- ✅ Integer outputs and calculations
- ✅ Loop counters and iterations
- ✅ User input with Scanner
- ✅ Mixed input types
- ✅ Proper output buffering
